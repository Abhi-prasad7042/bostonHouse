# Boston House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application designed to predict house prices in Boston using historical data. The web application is built with the Flask framework and styled with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. The dataset used for the prediction is available in the scikit-learn library.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Application**: Built using Flask, allowing users to input various features of the Boston housing dataset.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes scikit-learn to train a model for predicting house prices based on the provided features.
- **Stylish User Interface**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for modern aesthetics and Bootstrap for additional responsive design features.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/boston-house-price-prediction.git
   cd boston-house-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   conda create -p -n env python=3.10 -u
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**


     ```bash
